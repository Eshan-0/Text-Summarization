# 📄 PDF Summarizer & Question Answering App using NLP

A Streamlit-based Natural Language Processing application that extracts text from PDF documents, generates concise summaries, and allows users to ask intelligent questions based on the document content.

This project demonstrates practical NLP techniques such as TF-IDF scoring, sentence ranking, and semantic similarity.
